# Simple test script to generate output files of random numbers.
#
# This script currently has two test modes.
#
#  1. The default test is to generate files of random numbers using each
#     of the different RNG's, using different seeds and algorithms.
#     This test will hash each file using md5sum, and check that
#     hashes for a particular generator are unique.
#
#  2. If --run_dieharder is the first argument, then it will generate
#     a file of random numbers and run it through Dieharder.
#     This test generates a large file (e.g. about 15 GB).
#     so check for available disk space before running it...
